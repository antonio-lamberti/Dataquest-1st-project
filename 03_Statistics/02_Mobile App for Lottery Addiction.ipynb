    "# Fighting Lottery Addiction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We work for a medical institute aiming to prevent and treat gambling addictions. Many people start playing the lottery for fun, but for some, it escalates into addiction. Like other compulsive gamblers, lottery addicts start to accumulate debts and eventually engage in desperate behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to build a dedicated mobile app to help addicts estimate their chances of winning.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first version of the app, we will focus on the 6/49 lottery.,\n",
    "Six numbers are drawn from a set of 49. If a ticket matches all six numbers, the jackpot prize of at least 5,000,000 is won. A bonus number is also drawn, and if a player's ticket matches five numbers and the bonus number, the player wins the \"second prize,\" which is usually between 100,000 and 500,000. If the top prize is not won, the jackpot prize increases for the next draw.\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to define functions that will help the user to answer the below questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  - What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "  - What is the likelihood of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?\n",
    "  - What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining helper functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the project, we'll need to calculate repeatedly probabilities and combinations. As a consequence, we'll start by writing two functions that we'll use often:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - A function that calculates factorials; and\n",
    "  - A function that calculates combinations.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Let's start by defining the function `factorial.`\n",
    "we will use the below formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "                n! = n.(n-1).(n-2). ... . 2.1"
